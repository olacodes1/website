        <section class="about">
            <p>I'm Olanrewaju Olaniyi (a.k.a Olacodes), a digital designer at The Sole Company, Nigeria. I help businesses create usable, accessible, functional and beautiful digital products. I am passionate about solving complex problems through data driven processes that translate business objectives into solutions, putting empathy for the users as a key ingredient.</p>
    
            <p>My objective is to gather more experience and knowledge in niche, and to secure a career opportunity that expands my knowledge and fully utilize my knowledge, practice and skills, while ensuring result-oriented efforts in boosting the productivity of organizations.
            </p>
    
            <p>Except working with other designers who handle UX processes, most of my personal projects are based on concept, but I try to bring accessibility and usability into the equation to improve the experience.</p>
    
            <p>Animes, movies, football, and games are my compainion whenever I'm free or going through stress. They hep me a lot. My explorations involve <strong>Coding</strong>, <strong>Design System</strong>, <strong>Interaction Design</strong>, and the <strong>Word of God</strong>.</p>
